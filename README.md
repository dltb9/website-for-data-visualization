## Data Visualization Final Project--Yelp Business Exploration
## Description
we use Yelp data to analyze the number and popularity of different business in the United States. Some details of the restaurants are visualized to give more insight. Uses can choose the restaurants based on their own preferences. The visualization and website models can help user to filter out the results suit for them. In the paper, we use the JavaScript and D3.js library to create an interactive view. Also, we use the Tableau to build the detailed view for decision making.
## Tools
D3.js, Tableau
## Data
The data source comes from Yelp 2017 Dataset Challenge, which provides 6 tables, business, review, user, check-in, tip and photo table. In this paper, we describe the data more about the company level, thus we use business data as our dataset.  
Business data lists the name, location, business hours, cuisine categories, average star rating, evaluation quantity and other related factors, such as noise level, reservation policy. In addition, it contains 156639 business records. Most of these records are in the United States but the dataset only contains several statesâ€™ information and we use these records in our analysis. Bar chart and line chart can display the total number and tendency of the dataset. Those charts are useful tools in the data visualization area and we also apply these tools into our work.
